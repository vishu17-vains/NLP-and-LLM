# NLP and LLM Repository

Welcome to my **NLP and LLM Repository**! This repository serves as a showcase of my learning journey and hands-on projects in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview
This repository includes various scripts and projects aimed at understanding and implementing key NLP techniques and leveraging LLMs for advanced tasks. Each script is carefully designed to highlight specific concepts, ranging from text preprocessing to text generation using LLMs.

### Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming.
- **Vectorization Models**: Implementation of Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- **Language Models**: Exploration of LLMs for tasks such as text generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Application of ML algorithms to NLP tasks, such as classification and clustering.


## Learning Highlights
1. **Natural Language Processing**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed textual data using standard NLP techniques.
   - Transformed text into vectorized formats for machine learning applications.

2. **Large Language Models**:
   - Used pre-trained LLMs for advanced NLP tasks like summarization and text generation.
   - Experimented with fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific applications.

3. **Integration with Machine Learning**:
   - Built pipelines to apply ML models to vectorized text data for classification and clustering.
